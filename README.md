This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Why React for something so simple?
Because it's fast to make, and also easier. I keep my Resume/portfolio data in [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/), a CMS. It's much easier to update one thing that can be used anywhere than to update two independently. I can also draft and maintain things way faster?

### Is it really necessary to use that much JavaScript?
No of course not

### Would a static site be better?
Yeah
